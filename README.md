# Hotel-Management-System
Basic c++ CLI based project for beginners
The code in the file appears to be a C++ program designed to manage hotel reservations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the primary components and functionality based on the initial code segment:

Key Components:

struct Guest: This structure holds details of each hotel guest, including: name: Name of the guest. roomNumber: Room number assigned to the guest. duration: Length of the guest's stay. checkInDate and checkOutDate: Dates for the guest's stay. **roomRate: **Cost of the room per night.

Reservations Array: reservations[MAX_RESERVATIONS]: An array of Guest structures that holds up to 100 reservations. Reservation Management: There are likely additional functions for handling tasks like adding, deleting, or viewing reservations.

Purpose of the Project: This project aims to serve as a basic hotel reservation management system, where staff can record guest information, update reservations, and save.
